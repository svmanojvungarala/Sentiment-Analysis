# Sentiment-Analysis

Sentiment analysis holds a great value for business entities as they provide insights that might be useful for the sustenance of the business and turning the business profitable. Therefore  I'm performing sentiment analysis on a 9 years amazon dataset of beauty products. I'll be creating different classification models trained on this data, so that I can predict the sentiment of a new review. In order to choose the best classification model, I'll be training the models on different word embeddings generated from Countvectorizer, SVD embeddings, TF-IDF vectors and Word2Vec embeddings. I've chosen F1 score as a performance metrics as there is a class imbalance in the data.
